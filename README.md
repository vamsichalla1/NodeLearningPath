1. Understanding Node.js Basics
   Event Loop: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. Understanding the event loop and how asynchronous code execution works is crucial.
   Modules: Learn how to use require and module.exports to import and export functionalities across different files.
2. Express Basics
     Routing: Understand how to define routes and handle HTTP requests using different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
     Middleware: Learn how to use middleware for tasks like logging, authentication, parsing request bodies, and error handling.
     Static Files: Serve static files (HTML, CSS, JS) using express.static.
3. Working with Databases
     MongoDB: Learn how to use MongoDB with Node.js, including connecting to a database, defining schemas, and performing CRUD operations.
     Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js that helps manage relationships between data and provides schema validation.
4. Environment Variables
    dotenv: Use the dotenv package to manage environment variables. Create a .env file for sensitive configuration data like database connection strings.
5. Error Handling
      Basic Error Handling: Handle errors gracefully using try-catch blocks and middleware for centralized error handling.
6. Logging
   Winston: A versatile logging library
7. Security
    Helmet: Helps secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.
9. Deployment
    Hosting Services: Learn how to deploy your Node.js application to hosting services like Heroku, AWS, or Vercel.
10. Testing
